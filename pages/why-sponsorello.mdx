## Why Sponsorello?

**Sponsorello** was born because in [VLK Studio](https://vlkstudio.com) we wanted to fund open source projects applying a super simple process:

- Define a `budget`
- Select 20 open source projects we're using in our daily jobs
- Subscribe for a `(budget / 20)` monthly subscription to these projects
- We're happy and the world is a better place 🌎

After we started to do it, we thought that every company can do something like this, the budget doesn't matter, can be 20$ per month (so you're giving just 1$ per project) or 100, or 1000, if everyone will give something the eco-system of projects will grow dramatically.

So we created this website and here you are!

The name **Sponsorello** was chosen because:

- It sounds italian (yep, we are from Italy 🍝 🤌 🍕 🇮🇹 )
- The domain sponsorello.org was available
