## Where to focus

The main focus of this project is to raise awareness of the companies to the concept of open source, of course a lot of companies are already aware about it, but there still a lot that needs a little push.

We think that our [approach of funding](/why-sponsorhello) can be applied by every company, for this companies Sponsorhello can be a simple tool to understand which projects they will like to fund.

So if you want to help us, we suggest you to keep in mind this vision.
